The healthcare sector currently grapples with the absence of a centralized system for the
comprehensive management of patient records, leading to the fragmentation of medical
information across disparate entities. This mini-project aims to tackle the challenges
posed by the lack of a unified system by proposing the development of a web-based
Health Records Hub(HRH). The project focuses on creating a user-friendly and simple
website that acts as the interface for the HRH. The website will serve as a centralized
repository for patient records, offering a secure and inter-operable platform for healthcare
providers to share vital medical information. The system aims to facilitate seamless access
and mobility of patient data, overcoming issues related to record transfer, patient data
accessibility, and the redundancy of medical tests.
